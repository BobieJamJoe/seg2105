    "# Chapter 3 - Basing Software Development on Reusable Technology\n",
    "## Building on the Experience of Others\n",
    "- Software engineers should avoid re-developing software already developed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of reuse:\n",
    "- Reuse of **expertise**.\n",
    "- Reus of **standard designs** and algorithms.\n",
    "- Reuse of **libraries** of classes or procedures.\n",
    "- Reuse of powerful **commands** built into languages and operating systems.\n",
    "- Reuse of **frameworks**.\n",
    "- Reuse of complete **applications**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Frameworks: Reusable Subsystems\n",
    "- A *framework* is reusable software that implements a generic solution to a generalized problem.\n",
    "- It provides common facilities applicable to different application programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Principle**: Applications that do different, but related, things tend to have similar designs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Frameworks to promote reuse\n",
    "- A framework is intrinsically *incomplete*.\n",
    "- Certain classes or methods are used by the framework, but are missing (*slots*). It is mandatory to fill slots (abstract methods).\n",
    "- Some functionality is optional.\n",
    "    - Allowance is made for developer to provide it (*hooks* or *extension points*).\n",
    "- Developers use the *services* that the framework provides.\n",
    "    - Taken together the services are called the Application Program Interface (*API*).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Object-oriented Frameworks\n",
    "- In the object oriented paradigm, a framework is composed of a library of classes.\n",
    "- The API is defined by the set of all **public methods** of these classes.\n",
    "- Some of the classes will normally be abstract and there are often many Interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Frameworks and Product Lines\n",
    "- A product line (or product family) is a set of products built on a common base of technology.\n",
    "- The various products in the product line have **different features** to satisfy different markets.\n",
    "- The software **common to all products** is included in a framework.\n",
    "- Each product is produced by **filling the available hooks and slots**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Frameworks\n",
    "- A *horizontal* framework provides general application facilities that a large number of applications can use.\n",
    "- A *vertical* framework (*application framework*) is more 'complete' but still needs some slots to be filled to adapt it to specific application needs."

    "- Normally running on separate pieces of hardware that co-operate to perform the task of the system.\n",

    "- A program that *provides a service* for other programs that connect to it using a communication channel.\n",
