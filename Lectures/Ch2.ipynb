    "# Chapter 2 - Review of Object Orientation\n",
    "### What is Object Orientation?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Procedural paradigm:\n",
    "- Software is organized around the notion of *procedures*.\n",
    "- *Procedural abstraction*\n",
    "    - Works as long as the data is simple.\n",
    "- Adding *data abstractions* groups together the pieces of data that describe some entity.\n",
    "    - Helps reduce the system's complexity, such as records and structures.\n",
    "### Object oriented paradigm:\n",
    "- Organizing procedural abstractions in the context of data abstractions.\n",
    "- **All computations are performed in the context of objects.**\n",
    "- The objects are instances of classes, which:\n",
    "    - are data abstractions;\n",
    "    - contain procedural abstractions that operate on the objects;\n",
    "- A running program can be seen as a collection of objects collaborating to perform a given task.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classes and Objects\n",
    "- **Object**\n",
    "    - A chunk of structured data in a running software system.\n",
    "    - Has *properties* that represent its state.\n",
    "    - Has *behaviour* that describes how it acts and reacts. Its behaviour may simulate the behaviour of an object in the real world.\n",
    "- **Class**\n",
    "    - A unit of abstraction in an object oriented program.\n",
    "    - Represents similar objects - its *instances*.\n",
    "    - A kind of software module that describes its instances' structure (properties) and contains *methods* to implement their behaviour.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Variables\n",
    "- **A variable**\n",
    "    - *Refers* to an object.\n",
    "    - May refer to different objects at different points in time.\n",
    "- **An object can be referred to by several different variables at the same time.**\n",
    "- **Instance variables**\n",
    "    - Variables defined inside of a class corresponding to data present in each instance.\n",
    "    - Also called *fields* or *member variables*.\n",
    "    - Attributes: simple data.\n",
    "    - Associations: relationships to other important classes.\n",
    "- **Class variables**\n",
    "    - *Shared* by all instances of a class.\n",
    "    - Also called a *static* variable.\n",
    "    - If one instance sets the value of a class variable, then all the other instances see the same changed value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methods and Operations\n",
    "- **Operation**\n",
    "    - A higher-level procedural abstraction that specifies a type of behaviour.\n",
    "    - Independent of any code which implements that behaviour.\n",
    "- **Method**\n",
    "    - A procedural abstraction used to implement the behaviour of a class.\n",
    "    - Several different classes can have methods with the same name. They implement the same abstract operation in ways suitable to each class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Polymorphism\n",
    "- A property of object oriented software by which an *abstract operation may be performed in different ways* in different classes.\n",
    "- Requires that there be *multiple methods of the same name*.\n",
    "- The choice of which one to execute depends on the object that is in a variable.\n",
    "- Reduces the need for programmers to code many `if/else` or `switch` statements."

    "- **Superclasses*\n",

    "### Abstract Classes and Methods\n",
    "- An operation should be declared to exist at the highest class in the hierarchy where it makes sense.\n",
    "- The *operation* may be *abstract* (lacking implementation) at that level.\n",
    "- If so, the *class* also **must** be *abstract*.\n",
    "    - No instances can be created.\n",

    "- If a superclass has an abstract operation then its subclasses at some level must have a concrete method for the operation.\n",
    "    - Leaf classes must have or inherit concrete methods for all operations.\n",

    "- A method would be inherited, but a subclass contains a new version instead.\n",
    "    - For extension.\n",
    "    - For optimization.\n",
    "    - For restriction.\n",
    "- How a decision is made about which method to run:\n",
    "    1. If there is a concrete method for the operation in the current class, run that method.\n",
    "    2. Otherwise, check in the immediate superclass to see if there is a method there; if so, run it.\n",
    "    3. Repeat step 2, looking in successively higher superclasses until a concrete method is found and run.\n",
    "    4. If no mehtod is found, then there is an error.\n",
    "        - In Java and C++ the program would not have compiled.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dynamic Binding\n",
    "- Occurs when decision about which method to run can only be made at *run time*.\n",
    "- Needed when:\n",
    "    - A variable is declared to have a superclass as its type, and\n",
    "    - There is more than one possible polymorphic method that could be run among the type of the variable and its subclasses.\n",
    "- Dynamic binding rules:\n",
    "    1. Are you a superclass?\n",
    "        - Yes: Step 2\n",
    "        - No: Leaf class\n",
    "    2. Method is defined more than once?\n",
    "        - Yes: Dynamic binding is needed."
