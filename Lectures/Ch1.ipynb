    "- Real time embedded software.\n",
    "    - Control and monitoring systems.\n",
    "    - Must react immediately.\n",
    "    - Safety often a concern.\n",
    "- Data processing software.\n",
    "    - Used to run businesses.\n",
    "    - Accuracy and security of data are key.\n",

    "**Software engineering** is the process of **solving customers' problems**  by the systematic development and evolution of large, high-quality software systems within cost, time, and other constraints.\n",

    "**Solving customers' problems**:\n",
    "- The goal.\n",
    "- Sometimes the solution is to buy, not build.\n",
    "- Adding unnecessary features often makes software worse.\n",
    "- Software engineers must *communicate effectively* to identify and understand the problem.\n",

    "**Systematic development and evolution**:\n",
    "- An engineering process involves applying *well understood techniques* in an organized and *disciplined* way.\n",
    "- Many well-accepted practices have been formally standardized.\n",
    "- Most development work is *evolution*.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Large, high-quality software systems**:\n",
    "- Software engineering techniques are needed because large systems *cannot be completely understood* by one person.\n",
    "- Teamwork and coordination are required.\n",
    "- Key challenge: dividing up the work and ensuring that the parts of the system work properly together.\n",
    "- The end-product must be of sufficient quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cost, time, and other constraints**:\n",
    "- Finite resources.\n",
    "- The benefit must outweigh the cost.\n",
    "- Others are competing to do the job cheaper and faster.\n",
    "- Innacurate estimates of cost and time have caused many project failures.\n"
