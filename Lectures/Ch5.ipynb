    "# Chapter 5 - Modelling with Classes\n",
    "## What is UML\n",
    "- The Unified Modelling Language is a standard graphical language for modelling object oriented software.\n",
    "\n",
    "## UML Diagrams\n",
    "- Class diagrams\n",
    "    - describe **classes** and their **relationships**.\n",
    "- Interaction diagrams\n",
    "    - Sequence and communication diagrams.\n",
    "    - Show the **behaviour** of systems in terms of how objects **interact** with each other.\n",
    "- State diagrams and activity diagrams\n",
    "    - show how systems or classes **behave internally**.\n",
    "- Component and deployment diagrams\n",
    "    - show how the various components of systems are **arranged logically and physically**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Essentials of UML Class Diagrams\n",
    "***The main symbols shown on class diagrams are:***\n",
    "- *Classes*: represent the types of data themselves.\n",
    "- *Associations*: represent linkages between instances of classes.\n",
    "- *Attributes*: are simple data found in classes and their instances.\n",
    "- *Operations*: represent the *abstract* functions performed by the classes and their instances, as well as specific methods implementing these.\n",
    "- *Generalizations*: group classes into inheritance hierarchies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classes\n",
    "**A class is simply represented as a box with the name of the class inside.**\n",
    "- The diagram may also show the attributes and operations.\n",
    "- The complete signature of an operation is: `operationName(parameterName: parameterType ...): returnType`\n",
    "\n",
    "![UML Classes Examples](../Resources/UMLClasses.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Associations and Multiplicity\n",
    "**An *association* is used to show how two classes are related to each other**\n",
    "- Symbols indicating *multiplicity* are shown at each end of the association.\n",
    "- Associations are by default *bi-directional*.\n",
    "- It is possible to limit the direction of an association by adding an arrow at one end.\n",
    "\n",
    "![UML Associations Examples](../Resources/UMLAssociations.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each association can be labelled, to make explicit the nature of the asscciation.\n",
    "- Multiplicities:\n",
    "    - Constant (1, 2, 3, 4, etc.)\n",
    "    - Range (1...4, 0...*, etc.)\n",
    "    - Many (*)\n",
    "- Avoid unnecessary one-to-one associations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Association Classes\n",
    "- Sometimes, an attribute that concerns two associated classes cannot be placed in either of the classes.\n",
    "- The following are equivalent:\n",
    "\n",
    "![UML Association Classes Example](../Resources/UMLAssociationClasses.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reflexive Associations\n",
    "- It is possible for an association to connect a class to itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "![UML Reflexive Association Example](../Resources/UMLReflexiveAssociation.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reflexive associations can be asymmetrical or symmetrical:\n",
    "    - Asymmetrical associations are associations that are not identical between 2 objects that are associated to one another (e.g., a course has certain prerequisites and successors, but those prerequisites and successors won't have the same prerequisites and successors). Asymmetrical associations use 2 variables.\n",
    "    - Symmetrical relations are associations that are identical between two associated objects (e.g. if a user is friends with someone, that someone is also friends with them). Symmetrical relations use 1 variable."

    "### Generalization\n",
    "**Specializing a superclass into two or more subclasses**\n",
    "- A *generalization set* is a labeled group of generalizations with a common superclass.\n",
    "- The label (sometimes called the *discriminator*) describes the criteria used in the specialization.\n",

    "![Example use of discriminators](../Resources/DiscriminatorExample.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Object Diagrams\n",
    "- In order to create an object diagram, you have to first start with a class diagram.\n",
    "- A *link* is an instance of an association in the same way that we say an object is an instance of a class.\n",

    "- Associations describe the relationships that will exist between *instances* at run time.\n",
    "    - When you show an instance diagram generated from a class diagram, there will be an instance of *both* classes joined by an association.\n",
    "- Generalizations describe relationships between *classes* in class diagrams.\n",
    "    - They do not appear in instance diagrams at all.\n",
    "    - An instance of any class should also be considered to be an instance of each of that class' superclasses."
